# Data Structure UCO

Welcome to the Data Structure Ultimate Crossover (UCO). A repository where we attempt to implement as many Data Structures from scratch as we can in the Python language.

Data Structures are as per this Wikipedia List: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures

Feel free to contribute any new implementations (or improve existing ones)!
